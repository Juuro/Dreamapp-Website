ABOUT:
Gallery 3 is a web based software product that lets you manage
your photos on your own website.  You must have your own website
with PHP and database support in order to install and use it.
With Gallery you can easily create and share albums of photos
via an intuitive interface.


SECURITY (& INTENDED AUDIENCE):
This is the first technology preview of Gallery 3.0 and as such
it is not intended to be installed on public websites yet.
Note:
 - The application has not undergone a professional security audit
   yet and may have serious security vulnerabilities.
 - A series of key features are yet to be added (e.g. a way to
   reset a forgotten password).
 - There is no guaranteed upgrade path yet. You might be forced to
   reinstall Gallery 3 to use the next public release.

The intended audience of this release are enthusiasts, designers
and module developers. This is the right time to do a test drive
with the improved user interface and to start developing feature
extensions and designing new themes.
