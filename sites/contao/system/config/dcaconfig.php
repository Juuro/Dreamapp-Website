 * If you want to modify a data container file, you do not have to edit it
 * directly. You can save your changes in this configuration file instead.
 * Thus, you can update or replace the original files without having to
 * worry about your modifications.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 *   $GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_article']['config']['doNotCopyRecords'] = true;
 * 
 * This line would prevent articles from being duplicated when you duplicate
 * a page in module site structure.
