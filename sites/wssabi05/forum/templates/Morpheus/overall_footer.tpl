	We request you retain the full copyright notice below including the link to www.phpbb.com.
	This not only gives respect to the large amount of time given freely by the developers
	but also helps build interest, traffic and use of phpBB 2.0. If you cannot (for good
	reason) retain the full copyright we request you at least leave in place the 
	Powered by phpBB {PHPBB_VERSION} line, with phpBB linked to www.phpbb.com. If you refuse
	to include even this then support on our forums may be affected.

	You are allowed to use this phpBB style only if you agree to the following conditions:
	- You cannot remove my copyright notice from style without my permission.
	- You cannot use images from this style anywhere else without my permission.
	- You can convert this style to another software, but converted style must have my copyright including link to my website.
	- If you want to create new phpBB style based on this style you must ask my permission.
	- If you modify this style it still should contain my copyright because it is based on my work. Modified style should not be available for download without my permission.
