## This mod lets you display data from the phpBB forum on
## any page of your website. It uses phpBB to connect
## to the forum database and should therefor work if phpBB
## works.

## homepage using your layout and design. You can also use
## phpBB templates and make the script become a part of your
## forum.
##
## Manual install:
##
## Be sure to backup all files if you have an older version of
## this mod installed.
##
## 1. Create a directory 'mods' within your phpBB2 directory if
##    it does not already exists.
##
## 2. Upload the complete 'phpbb_fetch_all' folder into the
##    'mods' directory.
##
## 3. Open the following file in your browser:
##    phpBB2/mods/phpbb_fetch_all/examples/portal.php
