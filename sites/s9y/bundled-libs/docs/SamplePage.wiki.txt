+ Sample Page for Text_Wiki Default Markup

%%TOC%%

----

++ General Notes

The markup described on this page is for the default {{Text_Wiki}} rules; \
it is a combination of the [http://tavi.sourceforge.net WikkTikkiTavi] \
and [http://develnet.org/ coWiki] markup styles.

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as \
necessary.  This means that {{<}}, {{>}}, {{&}}, and so on are converted for \
you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup; \
Text_Wiki is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want \
to keep the same logical line but have to split it across \
two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number \
of characters per line), end the line with a backslash {{\}} and hit \
return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the \
backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab \
or space, it will ''not'' be joined with the next line, and the backslash \
will be printed.)

++ Inline Formatting

|| {{```''italic text''```}}                      || ''italic text'' ||
|| {{```'''bold text'''```}}                      || '''bold text''' ||
|| {{```'''''italic and bold'''''```}}            || '''''italic and bold''''' ||
|| {{```//emphasis//```}} || //emphasis// ||
|| {{```**strong**```}} || **strong** ||
|| {{```//**emphasis and strong**//```}} || //**emphasis and strong**// ||
|| {{```**//strong and emphasis//**```}} || **//strong and emphasis//** ||
|| {{```{{teletype text}}```}}                    || {{teletype text}} ||
|| {{<```php:function()```>}}                     || <php:function()> ||
|| {{```@@--- delete text +++ insert text @@```}} || @@--- delete text +++ insert text @@ ||
|| {{```@@--- delete only @@```}}                 || @@--- delete only @@ ||
|| {{```@@+++ insert only @@```}}                 || @@+++ insert only @@ ||
|| {{```super ^^1^^ script```}}                   || super ^^1^^ script ||

++ Literal Text

If you don't want Text_Wiki to parse some text, enclose it in 3 backticks (not 3 single-quotes).

<code>

This '''text''' gets {{parsed}}.

```This '''text''' does not get {{parsed}}.```

</code>

This '''text''' gets {{parsed}}.

```This '''text''' does not get {{parsed}}.```

----

++ Headings

You can make various levels of heading by putting \
equals-signs before and after the text (all on its \
own line):

<code>
+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading
</code>

+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading

----

++ Table of Contents

To create a list of every heading, with a link to that heading, put a table of contents tag on its own line.

<code>
%%TOC%%
</code>
----

++ Horizontal Rules

Use four dashes ({{```----```}}) to create a horizontal rule.

----

++ Lists

+++ Bullet Lists

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or \
more asterisks.

<code>
* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet
</code>

* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet

+++ Numbered Lists

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph \
with one or more hashes.

<code>
# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item
</code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item


+++ Mixing Bullet and Number List Items

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

<code>
# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
</code>

# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet



+++ Definition Lists

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<code>
:Item 1: Something
:Item 2: Something else
</code>

:Item 1: Something
:Item 2: Something else

----

++ Block Quotes

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' \
characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<code>
This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \ 
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \ 
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \ 
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \ 
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \ 
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of \
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote \
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of \
the line.
>

>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even \
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.

++ Links and Images

+++ Wiki Links

SmashWordsTogether to create a page link.

You can force a WikiPage name '''not''' to be clickable by putting \
an exclamation mark in front of it.

<code>
WikiPage !WikiPage
</code>

WikiPage !WikiPage

(Note: existing wiki pages must be in the Text_Wiki {{pages}} option array, \
and the {{view_url}} option must be set for the linking to work.)

+++ Free Links

Freelinks are "non-standard" Wiki links.

* You can refer to named anchors within pages like this: \
{{```((WikiPage#NamedAnchor))```}} becomes ((WikiPage#NamedAnchor)).
* You can create nice-looking links from WordsSmashedTogether like this: \
{{```((WordsSmashedTogether|Nice Link))```}} becomes \
((WordsSmashedTogether|Nice Link)).
* Refer to named anchors within nice-looking links like this: \
{{```((WikiPage|Nice Link#Anchor))```}} becomes \
((WikiPage|Nice Link#Anchor)).
* You can also create links that aren't WordsSmashedTogether \
(i.e., that have spaces) like this: {{```((free links))```}} \
becomes ((free links)).

(Note: existing wiki pages must be in the Text_Wiki {{pages}} option array, \
and the {{view_url}} option must be set for the linking to work.)

+++ Interwiki Links

Interwiki links are links to pages on other Wiki sites. \
Type the {{```SiteName:PageName```}} like this:

* MeatBall:RecentChanges
* Advogato:proj/WikkiTikkiTavi
* Wiki:WorseIsBetter

(Note: the interwiki site must be in the Text_Wiki {{interwiki}} option array.)

+++ URLs

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://ciaweb.net.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference \
and avoid cluttering the page; {{```[http://ciaweb.net/free/]```}} becomes [http://ciaweb.net/free/].

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:
<code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]
</code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]

+++ Images

You can put a picture in a page by typing the URL to the picture \
(it must end in gif, jpg, or png).
<code>
http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif
</code>

http://c2.com/sig/wiki.gif

You can use the described-reference URL markup to give the image an ALT tag:
<code>
[http://www.netropolisusa.biz/billthemarmet/MT/index/images/sunset_07_10_03.jpg Sunset]
</code>

[http://www.netropolisusa.biz/billthemarmet/MT/index/images/sunset_07_10_03.jpg Sunset]

++ Code Blocks

Create code blocks by using {{<code>...</code>}} tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>


To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, \
simply surround the code with {{<php>...</php>}} tags (the tags themselves \
should each be on their own lines, and no need for the {{&lt;?php ... ?&gt;}} tags).

<code>
<php>
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</php>
</code>

<php>
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</php>

++ Tables

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<code>
|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
</code>

|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||

<code>
|| lines must start and end || with double vertical bars || nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
